Cooperative multi-robot simulation in Gazebo using ROS for the Robotics Lab technical project
# Robotics Lab – Technical Project (Gazebo Multi-Robot Cooperation)

## 1) Problem Description
This project simulates an autonomous cooperative multi-robot system in Gazebo.
A mobile robot navigates to a pickup area and delivers an object to a handover zone.
Then a robotic manipulator detects the target (using tags/camera) and performs a pick-and-place task.

**Robots**
- Mobile robot: TurtleBot3 (differential drive)
- Manipulator: UR5 / Franka Panda (with gripper)

## 2) Simulation Setup (to be completed)
- Custom Gazebo world with walls, obstacles, objects, and tags.

## 3) System Architecture (to be completed)
- ROS nodes, topics/services/actions, launch/config files.

## 4) Results (to be completed)
- Demo video link and screenshots.

## Requirements
- Ubuntu + ROS (ROS1 Noetic recommended) + Gazebo

## How to Run
(Will be added after implementation)
